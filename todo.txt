AND AS THE ANOTHER PART OF THIS EXCERSIZE WE HAVE THIS In this Exercise, 
you learned about the importance of authentication and authorization, along with 
a few different means of applying it in web applications. Let’s now apply what 
you’ve learned to your myFlix API.

Directions:

Install the necessary packages/libraries for basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication with Passport.
Create a new file, “passport.js”, in your project directory.
In this file, define your two authentication strategies: “LocalStrategy” and “JWTStrategy.”
Create a new file, “auth.js”, in your project directory.
In your new “auth.js” file, create a new “/login” endpoint for registered users 
that contains logic for authenticating users with basic HTTP authentication and generating 
a JWT token for authenticating future requests.
Add the following code to your “index.js” file to ensure your application can make use of 
your “auth.js” file, and that your “auth.js” file can use Express: let auth = require('./auth')(app);
Integrate your two Passport strategies as middleware into each of your existing API endpoints so 
that only users with a JWT token can make requests to your API.
Remember to exclude the API endpoint for “adding a new user.” If added, your app’s users will 
be restricted from registering due to the authentication measures applied.
Test each method using Postman and take screenshots documenting each test.
Update your project directory on GitHub to reflect these changes and submit 
a link to your project here, along with a PDF or zip file containing your 
test result screenshots, for your tutor to review.
